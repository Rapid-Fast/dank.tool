# ðŸš¨ SirDank's dank.tool ðŸš¨

- An all-in-one, portable windows executable with a wide variety of features built with python!

- This tool will rarely need to be updated as it executes the latest source code straight from GitHub for both the tool itself and its modules!

- Note: The dank.tool executable might be flagged as malware since it has been built using python. Also try to not spam the [ enter ] key on the exe, as it can cause the program to take in the wrong input. If this has occurred, close the exe and relaunch it.

- Short URL: https://bit.ly/dank-tool

- Direct download: https://bit.ly/dank-tool-download
